2. Write a program to input 2 numbers and one arithmetic operator. Perform operations as per arithmetic operator which is given as input

a = int(input("enter 1st number: "))
b = int(input("enter 2nd number: "))

addition = a + b
subtraction = a - b
multiplication = a * b
division = a / b

#print(f"addition of {a} and {b} is : {addition}")
#print(f"subtraction of {a} and {b} is : {subtraction}")
#print(f"multiplication of {a} and {b} is : {multiplication}")
#print(f"division of {a} and {b} is : {division}")
#-------------------------------------------------or--------------------------

print("addition of", a, "and", b, "is :", addition)
print("subtraction of", a, "and", b, "is :", subtraction)
print("multiplication of", a, "and", b, "is :", multiplication)
print("division of", a, "and", b, "is :", division)
